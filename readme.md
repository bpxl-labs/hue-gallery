### Running Locally
```
$ git clone https://github.com/bpxl-labs/hue-gallery.git
$ cd hue-gallery
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### TODO
- [x] Cache `color-thief` calls
- [x] Implement an algorithm to get 3 brightest colors
- [x] Convert RGB to CIE 1931 X,Y format for Philips Hue
- [x] Give user control to select which room
- [ ] Improve UX for room selection
- [ ] Improve UX for initial bridge registration
- [ ] Add support for responsive images
- [ ] Save settings on a global or per-site basis

### Future enhancements/questions
- Should Hue Gallery be broken out into its own Chrome extension?
  - What sites should it initially support?
  - How do we handle more than one image in viewport?
  - How do we handle lightbox-style components?
